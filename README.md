# Risk-assessment
# NAME: VIMALA RANI A
# REG NO: 212223040240

## Aim:
To perform an asset-oriented risk assessment of cloud storage assets including:
● AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)

● AWS Elastic File System (EFS)

● Azure Files (File Storage)

## Pre-requisites:

# 1.Background:
Cloud storage services offer flexible, scalable options for storing data. However, each storage type
brings distinct security risks and configurations. This experiment focuses on identifying assets and
performing a detailed risk assessment based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA), access
control, encryption, and auditing capabilities.

# 2.Tools Required:
● AWS Console with EC2, EBS, and EFS access

● Azure Portal with Storage Account access

● IAM credentials with sufficient permissions

● Risk Assessment Template (provided)

● Internet browser

● Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets for  tabulating findings

## 4. Procedure:

Part A: Identifying AWS Storage Assets

Step 1: Login to AWS Console

● Go to https://aws.amazon.com/console

● Log in using IAM or root credentials


Step 2: Identify EBS Volumes

● Navigate to EC2 > Volumes (under Elastic Block Store)

● Observe and record the following for each volume:

● Volume ID

● Size and Type (e.g., gp2, io1)

● Availability Zone

● Attached instance (if any)

● Encryption status

● Tags

Step 3: Identify EFS File Systems

● Go to EFS > File systems

● For each file system, record:

● File system ID and name

● Mount targets (AZs)

● Throughput mode (bursting/provisioned)

● Performance mode

● Lifecycle policy

● Encryption at rest status

Part B: Identifying Azure File Storage Assets


Step 4: Login to Azure Portal

● Go to https://portal.azure.com

● Log in using credentials with access to storage accounts


Step 5: View File Shares

● Navigate to Storage Accounts > Choose Account > File Shares

● For each file share, record:

● Name

● Quota (in GB)

● Used space

● Protocol (SMB/NFS)

● Authentication method (SAS Tokens, Azure AD, Shared Keys)

● Snapshot policies

## 5. Risk Assessment Methodology

Use the following CIA-based asset-oriented checklist for each asset:

## 6. Observations and Tabulation
Cloud

Provider

Asset Type Asset ID Encrypted Access Control Risk Level Comments

AWS EBS Volume vol-abc Yes IAM Policy Medium Used by EC2

AWS EFS fs-xyz Yes Security Group Low Multi-AZ mount

Azure File Share datafiles Yes Shared Key Medium Quota 1TB


## Result:
You have identified all active storage assets and evaluated them based on security posture and risk level.
